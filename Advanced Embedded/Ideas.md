Could take the stat and make it a wireless environment sensor for a lab room or somethign

Could make it a smart greenhouse monitor lol

Could also have it connected to a fan to control the environment in a smart plant room

Or for something like a server room/greenhouse/multizone environment

--> also have it mapped to something else, as well as a water pump system, need to 

Make it multinodal -- zigbee is used so it can be placed in different rooms and report to one hub for a lab environment
