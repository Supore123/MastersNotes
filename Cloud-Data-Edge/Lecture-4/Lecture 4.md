## ðŸ§© Key Concepts
- Historical Perspective of how machines and operations worked
- Networks are needed to handle the transfer of data between them all

-  Design importance of the network -- Need to consider:
			- Topology
			- Routing Algorithm
			- Switching Strategy
			- Flow Control
		These points consider the requirements for how networks operate
- Can have Direct and Indirect Networks:
	- Direct: Every switch is also a network end point
	- Indirect: Not all switches are end points
	-These are the key performance properties for network design:
		- Diameter
1		- Latency
- Performance properties are measured via bandwidth

## ðŸ§® Math & Intuition
$$
	bandwidth =  \frac {w}{t}
$$

## ðŸ§  Insights
- Bandwidth design is important -- note the reamining setup required
- How does bisection bandwidth operate for non-even number in network
-
