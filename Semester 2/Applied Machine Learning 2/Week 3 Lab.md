## Implementation Objective
> Trying to implement the CNN & semantic segmentation 
> Trying to understand the mathematics for the understanding of batch normalisation on convergence and gradient flow through ResNet

##  Code Snippet
```python
import torchw
import torch.nn as nn

def implementation_logic():
    # Use this section for the most concise, working version of the code
    pass
```

When implementing ResNet  refer to code for the following 

$$\pmatrix{W}^T matrix$$
