# Combined Lecture with NLP
## Executive Summary
> MLP for NLP tasks and sentiment analysis
> Needs to be the same lecture setup for handling the CNN and MLP so it is required

## Recap of NLP and AMLS II
- The NLP Pipeline:
	- Raw text -> Breaking text into units(tokenization) --> Creating a vector from these tokens (vectorization) -> Capturing context is required from the vector pairing, what should be represented (text representation))-> Statistical model for making the prediction --> Prediction
- The goal of this pipeline for NLP is to transform raw unstructured data into mathematical format for probabilitic decision-making
- Modern deep learning is to do with contentualisation, moving from static word meaning to sentence-dependent meanings
## Statistical Pipeline
- A more formal setup of what is occuring is when tokenization is just the seperating and handling of each part --> i.e: breaking down each part of the token.
