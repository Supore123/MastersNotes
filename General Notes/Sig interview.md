As a researcher at SIG, you will certainly not be short of inetllectual stimulation. This is a technically advanced, problem-solving position. SIG understands this, and has resources and systems in place to ensure that you can make the most of your skills, while practicing a sustainable lifestyle.

To become a quantitative researcher at SIG, depending on whether you're a masters hire or a PhD hire, you must meet a select number of prerequisites. However, please note that this is a competitive position, and you will need to go above and beyond with your qualifications and experience to stand out in interviews.

SIG lists the following as mandatory to be considered for a quantitative researcher role:

To be more competitive within the interview process, consider these attributes and qualifications:

- Experience in competitive and strategic environments to a high/professional standard (e.g. sports, chess, poker)

- High technical research theses

Please note that these are a few attributes that would be beneficial to improve your chances of landing a quantitative trading position. There are multiple other experiences/qualifications that will also be beneficial, but the qualities from these attributes are highly valued on the research side at quantitative trading firms.
