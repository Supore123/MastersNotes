#### Data Storage
		Important factors for determining storage is: object model, the format and the database type
	-- i/e: What we store, how we transfer it and WHO stores it in the end.
**Data Storage**: Data storage is the retention of inromation using technology specifically developed to keep that data and have it as accessible as neccessary

**Object Model**: A data model is the abstraction of a real world object or concept 

An object model is defined by the set 
-- How do we define which properites to store, how do you define a commit object, 

**Minimal Properties:**
	- Only useful properties
	- In the lowest scope possible
	- Orthogonal to each other

-- If both are being used as objects model -- would you use the Author object type. This means it's not

Less hierarchical since it is an object model. 
-- Goal of object
Still an open source
