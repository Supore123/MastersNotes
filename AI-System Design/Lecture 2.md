## ðŸ§© Data Acquisition
-  N.B. Note a machine learning course -- just for AI System design -- the algorithms themselves need independent study to handle. This is 
- 
- Data Acquisition: The **process** with the goal to ensure the data is provided to the AI pipeline. Effectively we are taking messy, unstructured information, and acquisition is the process of organizing and storing in a systematic method.
	- ^ Core to to the AI pipeline
- Data acquisition process occurs through APIs.

## Sources of Data
- **Sources of Data**: Where does it come from?
Requirements of collection of input and outputs data. 
 **Trivial method**: human labeling. Just measure some which are and some which aren't.
 - Three categories of data:
	 1) Live Data: Continuous stream, flexible and abundant. (i.e: directly connected to a sensor)
	 2) Historical Data: (just old stored data, i.e: if I check the stock market from 1st Jan 2017, the API pulls the same info no matter what).
	 3) Synthetic Data: Fake generated data, can be cheap and easy but can be considered to be unreliable. Can be useful since it avoids privacy concern. Could be bullshit tho
